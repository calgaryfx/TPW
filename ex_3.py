# Ex.3: Area of a Room (p.4)
width = float(input("Please enter the width of the room in meters: "))
length = float(input("Please enter the length of the room in meters: "))
area = width * length
print(f"The area of the room equals: {area}m.")


# Task: Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room.
# Once the values have been read, the program should compute and display the area of
# the room.
# The length and width will be entered as floating point numbers.
# Include units in your prompt and output message; either feet or meters, depending
# on which unit you are more comfortable working with.
