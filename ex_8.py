# Ex.8: Widgets and Gizmos (p.5).

# Widget and Gizmos weights in grams.
widget_weight = 75
gizmo_weight = 112

# Order.
widgets = int(input("How many widgets do you want to order? "))
gizmos = int(input("How many gizmos do you want to order? "))

# Compute weight.
total_weight = (widgets * widget_weight) + (gizmos * gizmo_weight)

# Display weight of the order.
print(f"The total weight of your order is {total_weight} grams.")

# Task: An online retailer sells two products: Widgets and gizmos. Each Widget
# weighs 75 grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that reads the
# number of widgets and the number of gizmos in an order from the user. Then compute
# and display the total weight of the order.
# The Python Workbook practice. No solution given.
