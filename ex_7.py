# Ex.7: Sum fo the First n Positive Integers (p.5).

# User input positive integer
n = int(input("Input a positive number: "))

# Calculate and display the sum.
sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
print(sum)

# Task: Write a program that reads a positive integer, n, from the user and then
# displays the sum of all the integers from 1 to n.
# The sum of the first n positive integers can be computed with this formula:
# sum = n * (n + 1) / 2
